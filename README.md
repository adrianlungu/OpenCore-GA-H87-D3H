# GA-H87-D3H running on OpenCore 0.5.7 (High Sierra)

Just managed to upgrade my hackintosh to **High Sierra** and switch from **Clover** to **OpenCore 0.5.7**.

*(can't go further than High Sierra right now since I'm running on a GTX1060; rip web drivers)â€‹*

## System Specs

- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H87-D3H

- Limit CPUID Maximum - Disabled
- Execute Disable Bit - Enabled
- Intel Virtualization Tech - Enabled
- Intel TXT Support - Disabled
- VT-d - Disabled
- Windows 8 Features - OtherOS ~~Windows 8~~ *(Booting would result in Black Screen if the HDMI port was being used with the Windows 8 option; works with OtherOS; has to do with CSM)*
- ~~CSM Support - Never~~

### Peripherals

## What's Working

So far I've only tested the installation process, booting, Nvidia Web Drivers and a few other things and they're all working properly. I'll update the list after further testing.

- [x] Installation
- [x] Booting
- [x] GPU / Nvidia Web Drivers
- [x] Bootcamp
- [x] Sleep
- [ ] Audio - Not sure - I use an USB Audio Card

## How can I use this ?

You can just use the EFI folder in the repository as is to boot either a High Sierra installation disk or boot into your existing Mac installation. 

Do test using an USB stick before overwriting any existing Clover/OpenCore installation as issues could occur. 

If you find a better configuration for these specs, feel free to make a pull request or open an issue!
